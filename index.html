                <h1>Purpose of the Novel</h1>
                <p>This novel was written in a time of great stigma toward the mentally ill, but one with great change on 
                the way. In fact, at around the time the novel was written, then President Nixon tried to withhold (impound)
                funds for community mental health centers. Mental Health America was an especially active group at this time, 
                not only in ensuring that funds were given to build mental health centers but also in trying to raise awareness
                to the struggles of the mentally ill through projects like the production of the 1971 film "Only Human".<abbr title="'Our History.' Mental Health America. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 May 2016.">[1]</abbr></p>
                <p>As such, Guest hoped to shed light on the struggles of a family dealing with depression. In fact, Judith Guest said:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>She said somehting... about how the point of the novel was... mental healthy stuff</p>
