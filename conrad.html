                                        The 'it' that Conrad refers to in this passage is his inner desire to blame himself for the death of his brother. This
                                        inner desire is his id attempting to rationalize the circumstances surrounding his brother's passing. The struggle
                                        occurs because his superego is able to understand that it is not his fault, but his id desires immediate rationalization.
                                        In fact, Con is beginning to more strongly be aware of his obsession with punishing himself for his percieved
                                        guilt in his brother’s death.

                                        By explaining his view that things or either good or evil, Conrad is displaying the ego defense mechanism of splitting. The ego is
                                        forced to mediate between the id, which suggests the primal way of thinking, that there are only evil and good, or innocent and
                                        guilty. Meanwhile, the superego is quietly pushing for moral judgement about people, not just this primal binary. In this way,
                                        this Id-Superego conflict pushes Conrad realise that he should not be so concerned with his own guilt over his brother’s death but
                                        admit the complexities of the situation in that he cannot continue to punish himself for an event that he could not control.
